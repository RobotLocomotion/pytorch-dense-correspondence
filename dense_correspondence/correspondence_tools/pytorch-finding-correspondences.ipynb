    "## Timing Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a little subtle -- cold start switching to the GPU is slow on the first image (takes a couple seconds). But on the second time on that image, the matching is quite fast, just slightly faster than the CPU (~0.018 vs 0.023 seconds).  You might think this is only because it's the same image, but no -- loading in a different image still doesn't see the 2-second cold start. (Perhaps there is pre-fetching?  Would be interested to look into it more in future.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Big picture though, this margin is not that large, and so without looking in deeper, computation time might be dominated by something agnostic to whether ths reprojection runs on CPU or GPU (for example, image io).\n",
    "\n",
    "And an additional benefit is that by keeping on CPU, we will not need to take any additional precious GPU memory during training, allowing batch sizes to be higher for training.  (This process of generating correspondences happens during training, generated with each randomly selected pairs of same-scene RGBD images in the training set.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So all in all, I am guessing this step of my pipeline will stay on CPU.  But the peace of mind is priceless knowing how fast it _could_ have been on the GPU!\n",
